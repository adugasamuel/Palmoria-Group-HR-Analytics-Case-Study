Palmoria Group HR Analytics Case Study
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company in Nigeria, faced challenges related to gender inequality, pay gaps, and compliance with new wage regulations.
As an HR Analytics expert, I was tasked to analyze employee data across three regions (Abuja, Kaduna, Lagos) and provide actionable insights for management decision-making.

This project simulates a real-world HR analytics scenario, applying end-to-end data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting.

Evaluate performance ratings by gender.

Investigate salary structure and identify possible gender pay gaps.

Assess compliance with the new $90,000 minimum wage policy.

Group employees by salary bands ($10k intervals).

Calculate and allocate bonus pay based on performance ratings.

Provide actionable recommendations for management.
